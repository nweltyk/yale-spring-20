        This diary lasts about six months. Day by day, as twilight falls, Vowl jots down, in a typically finicky fashion, a host of insignificant notations: drank up all my provision of liquor, bought an LP for my cousin J ulot for passing his bac with flying colours, took my Moroccan kaftan to a local laundry, said hullo to a man living down my road notwithstanding that Azor, his pug-dog, has a habit of shitting on my doormat, and so on; notations, too, on his books, on his chums, on a puzzling word or an intriguing fact (a QC at court who couldn't finish his oration; a hooligan firing blank shots at nobody in particular; a compositor at a printing plant wilfully vandalising his own typographic apparatusâ€¦).
